# xyzDAO
We noticed a problem where the most popular video streaming platform, YouTube, requires you to have minimum of  4,000 watch hours on your channel to be monetized. Even if someone uploads quality content, they are unable to monetize their channel due to a lack of views. As a result, xyzDAO is attempting to solve this problem where you do not have to rely on any algorithm to increase the number of views ,on our platform the community you are targeting 
can support your content directly and help you grow an "OG" community where the first believers of your content are also rewarded.

Following is the methodology we have used to devlop this project :

@Smart-contract: Connect wallet and become a member of  xyzDAO by donating 100TFIL towards xyz DAO ecosystem.
@FEVM + FilecoinWeb3Storage : Membership gives you the ability to propose & vote for the content you want by simply donating 20TFIL. We use TFIL to deal with market and store the content on Filecoin. Voting gives you the ability to earn incentives when a person interacts with that content.
A non-member can also watch the video you chose. xyzDAO allows it's voters and creators to earn incentives based on the traffic on that content by using advertisement 
as the income source.
Content creator can upload their video by simply creating a 
proposal on xyz DAO platform.
